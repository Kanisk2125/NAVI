Problem Statement:

Every day, women are assaulted, molested, and violated on the streets of their own cities. Violence against women happens all over the world, particularly in developing countries. This violence can take many forms: physical, sexual, or psychological.Physical assault on women involves the use of force to injure or endanger them. Forms of sexual assault include rape, human trafficking and forced sexual exploitation, genital mutilation, child marriage, and intimate partner violence. Psy- chological abuse results in psychological trauma, which could manifest as chronic depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder. The above all have severe consequences on a womanâ€™s physical and mental well-being. Women's safety is a major concern worldwide, where issues such as theft, bullying, and sexual injustice are prevalent. The traditional methods of addressing these issues, such as relying on the local police, are often ineffective and time-consuming. The problem is to develop a mobile application that can provide fast and easy access to help for women in serious or dangerous situations, and that includes features such as SOS, voice command, maps, shake for emergencies, make calls to added numbers, police stations, and tips for safety.

The application will include features such as an SOS button, voice command, maps, shake for emergency,make calls to added numbers, police stations, police stations and tips for safety. The ultimate aim of this project, is to effectively build an app for woman safety in our society by providing them with a reliable and easy-to-use tool that can help them in times of need. We tried to achieve this by making a mobile application that:

Has a simple and straightforward user interface
Ensures that call alert is sent to the police and message alerts to both police and close friends.
Allows user to send location as well.
Allows users to learn about the basic laws and self techniques to protect themselves. The reason behind creating a mobile application to achieve the problem statement was due to the fact that a mobile phone is normally carried by everyone and is always along with any person.
